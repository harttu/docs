# How to clone wiki

Append .wiki.git to the repository name.

That is, if your repository name was foobar:

git clone git@github.com:myusername/foobar.git would be the path to clone your repository

and

git clone git@github.com:myusername/foobar.wiki.git would be the path to clone its wiki.

Note: You must have at least one page to be able to clone the wiki repo. (via @tobiasz-cudnik)
